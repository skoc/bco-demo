  "usability_domain": "This workflow performs the first step of RNA-seq analysis - alignment to a reference genome and transcriptome. \n\n**STAR** (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference), an ultrafast RNA-seq aligner, is used in this workflow. **STAR** is capable of mapping full length RNA sequences and detecting de novo canonical junctions, non-canonical splices, and chimeric (fusion) transcripts. **STAR** employs an RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. It is optimized for mammalian sequence reads, but fine tuning of its parameters enables customization to satisfy unique needs [1].\n\n*A list of **all inputs and parameters** with corresponding descriptions can be found at the bottom of this page.*\n\n### Common Use Cases\n\nThe main idea behind this workflow is to generate aligned BAM files (in genome and transcriptome coordinates) from RNA-seq data, which can later be used in further RNA studies, like gene expression analysis for example. \n\nThe important notes about the workflow are: \n\n- The workflow consists of two steps: **STAR Genome Generate**, which generates the necessary index files for the alignment procedure, and **STAR** itself, which does the alignment.\n- The main input to the workflow are **Reads** (`--readFilesIn`) in FASTQ format (single end or paired end), or unaligned BAM format.\n- A **Reference or index** file also needs to be provided. If the index archive is already generated for the desired reference, it can be provided instead of the reference in order to skip indexing and save computation time. Otherwise, a reference FASTA file is required here.\n- If a FASTA file is provided as an input, a **Splice junctions GTF file** (`--sjdbGTFfile`) should also be provided. It’s generally a good idea to always provide a GTF file to the inputs, if you want to get the **Transcriptome aligned reads** and **Reads per gene** outputs. \n- The main output of this workflow is the **Aligned reads** output in coordinate-sorted BAM format. The **Transcriptome aligned reads** BAM file is also produced by default. \n- Gene counts are also outputted by default on the **Reads per gene** output. \n- STAR can detect chimeric transcripts, but the parameter **Min segment length** (`--chimSegmentMin`) in *Chimeric Alignments*  category must be adjusted to a desired minimum chimeric segment length (12 is a good value, as recommended by the **STAR-Fusion** wiki, which is set by default). This output can later be used in **STAR-Fusion** for further fusion analysis. \n- If you want to use **STAR** results as an input to an RNA-seq differential expression analysis (using the **Cufflinks** app), set the parameter **Strand field flag** (`--outSAMstrandField`) to **intronMotif**.\n- Unmapped reads are outputted by default, both in FASTQ format on the **Unmapped reads** output, and within the main out BAM file on the **Aligned reads** and **Transcriptome aligned reads** outputs. \n- A basic **Two-pass mode** is also turned on during the alignment step, which means that all the first pass junctions will be inserted into the genome indices for the second pass. \n\n###Common issues###\n- For paired-end read files, it is important to properly set the **Paired-end** metadata field on your read files.\n- For FASTQ reads in multi-file format (i.e. two FASTQ files for paired-end 1 and two FASTQ files for paired-end2), the proper metadata needs to be set (the following hierarchy is valid: **Sample ID/Library ID/Platform Unit ID/File Segment Number**).\n- The GTF and FASTA files need to have compatible transcript IDs and chromosome names.\n\n### Changes Introduced by Seven Bridges\n\n- All output files will be prefixed by the input sample ID (inferred from the **Sample ID** metadata if existent, of from filename otherwise), unless the **Output file name prefix** option is explicitly specified.\n- **Unmapped reads** in FASTQ format are by default unsorted by read ID. This can induce problems if these files are used in a subsequent analysis (i.e. downstream alignment). This is changed in this workflow - unmapped reads are by default sorted by read ID. This option can be turned off to decrease workflow runtime by a small margin, if unmapped reads are not of further interest. The suffix for the **Unmapped reads** output can be controlled by the **Unmapped output file names** options (the default is *Unmapped*).\n- The workflow can accept uncompressed FASTQ files, as well as GZ and BZ2 compressed FASTQ files, without the user having to specify anything. Also, if unaligned BAM files are used as inputs, the single-end/paired-end flag (SE/PE) needn't be specified - it will be inferred automatically using a built-in **Samtools** script. \n\n### Performance Benchmarking\n\nBelow is a table describing the runtimes and task costs for a couple of samples with different file sizes, with the following workflow options in mind - indexing is not performed, unmapped reads are sorted by read id, output BAM is sorted by coordinate and basic two pass mode is turned on:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Experiment type |  Input size | Paired-end | # of reads | Read length | Duration |  Cost |  Instance (AWS) |\n|:---------------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:-----:|:----------:|\n|     RNA-Seq     |  2 x 230 MB |     Yes    |     1M     |     101     |   18min   | $0.40 | c4.8xlarge |\n|     RNA-Seq     |  2 x 4.5 GB |     Yes    |     20M     |     101     |   30min   | $0.60 | c4.8xlarge |\n|     RNA-Seq     | 2 x 17.4 GB |     Yes    |     76M    |     101     |   64min  | $1.20 | c4.8xlarge |\n\n*Cost can be significantly reduced by using **spot instances**.

        "description": "**STAR Genome Generate** produces the necessary index files for successful **STAR** alignment, from an input FASTA and GTF files.  \n\n**STAR** (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference), an ultrafast RNA-seq aligner, is capable of mapping full length RNA sequences and detecting de novo canonical junctions, non-canonical splices, and chimeric (fusion) transcripts. **STAR** employs an RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. It is optimized for mammalian sequence reads, but fine tuning of its parameters enables customization to satisfy unique needs [1].\n\n*A list of **all inputs and parameters** with corresponding descriptions can be found at the bottom of this page.*\n\n### Common Use Cases\n\n**STAR Genome Generate** is a tool that generates genome index files. One set of files should be generated per each FASTA/GTF combination. Once produced, these files could be used as long as FASTA/GTF combination stays the same. Also, **STAR Genome Generate** which produced these files and **STAR** aligner using them must be of the same toolkit version.\n\n* If the indexes for a desired FASTA/GTF pair have already been generated, make sure to supply the resulting TAR bundle to the tool input if you are using this tool in a workflow in order to skip unnecessary indexing and speed up the whole workflow process.\n* If you are providing a GFF3 file (which are usually downloaded from **NCBI's RefSeq database**) and wish to use **STAR** results for further downstream analysis, a good idea would be to set the **Exon parent name** (`--sjdbGTFtagExonParentTranscript`) option to **Parent**.\n* If you wish to run **STAR** in **multiple samples two-pass mode**, you need to provide the resulting **splice junction** outputs from **STAR** to the **List of annotated junctions** (`--sjdbFileChrStartEnd`) input of **STAR Genome Generate**, and generate the index archive with these, instead of supplying the GTF file [2]. \n\n###Common issues###\n\n* If the reference genome used has a bit number of contig sequences (>5000), a suggestion is to set the **Bins size** (`--genomeChrBinNbits`) parameter to the value of min(18, log2(GenomeLength/NumberOfReferences)). \n* If the reference genome used is a rather small genome, a suggestion is to set the **Pre-indexing string length** (`--genomeSAindexNbases`) parameter to the value of min(14, log2(GenomeLength)/2 - 1). \n* If **STAR Genome Generates** for some reason fails because of insufficient RAM problem, the **Limit Genome Generate RAM** (`--limitGenomeGenerateRAM`) parameter can be increased to make the RAM demands, though since the default value is 60GB, this should only be happening with extremely large reference files (for example, 30GB is enough for the human reference genome). \n* The GTF and FASTA files need to have compatible transcript IDs and chromosome names.\n\n### Changes Introduced by Seven Bridges\n\n* The directory containing the index files will be outputted as a TAR bundle (the **Genome files** output). This bundle can then be provided to the **STAR** aligner, which will automatically take care of untarring it and preparing it to run successfully without further issues. \n\n### Performance Benchmarking\n\nSince **STAR Genome Generate** is run with a FASTA/GTF combination, the runtime of this tool will be pretty much constant across a number of different genomes. For the human reference genome, the tool is expected to finish in around 30 minutes, costing around $0.75 on the c4.8xlarge AWS instance. \n\n*Cost can be significantly reduced by using **spot instances**.
